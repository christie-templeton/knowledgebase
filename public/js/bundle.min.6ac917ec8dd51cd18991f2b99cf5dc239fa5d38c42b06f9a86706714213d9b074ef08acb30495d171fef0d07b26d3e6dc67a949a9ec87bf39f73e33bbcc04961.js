Read more about her experience and how she can help your business manage and create documentation on a site like this by visiting her site https://ChristieTempelton.pro Why Your Business Needs a Technical Writer More often than not, businesses and organizations believe that anyone can write. The task of gathering technical information, writing, and editing is given to an engineer or technical employee who hasn’t acquired any professional writer’s training or even basic skills, such as how to follow a writing style guide, or how to select and use the appropriate software for the job. This results in documentation that is hard to comprehend, full of errors and misspellings, and that doesn’t follow a common format which lends to it looking less than professional. Hiring a Professional Technical Writer Solves this Problem I help clarify complicated concepts through translating business and technical jargon into simpler language, helping your organization meet the needs of your target audience. I consider content from the user’s perspective and know how to connect to your audience through professional technical documentation that is concise, impartial, and states the facts clearly. I possess the special talent of understanding complex content from both the viewpoint of industry-experts and the average consumer. My primary objective beyond gathering information and understanding your process is to provide immaculate documentation that not only makes your organization meet its goals better, but also makes your organization look as professional as possible. But Don’t Think Traditional, Bland and Boring Technical Writing! Gone are the days of pages of static text with long paragraphs that make your head swim after just a few minutes of reading it. Today’s Technical Writing demands modern formatting, styling, and supportive media to be competitive and effective. I also have complementary skills that will enhance any kind of documentation I provide to you. These skills include web design, graphic design, motion graphics, video production, and other related skills that allow me to take your documentation to the next level. From the document layout and font to the appropriate size for charts, my job is to make your content look and read professional. And There’s More to Technical Writing than Just Writing Before the writing can even begin, the information to be published must be obtained. Technical Writing relies heavily on the ability to perform research to find the right stakeholders, subject matter experts, as well as internal and external resources. In a busy organization, it can be challenging to extract the information from employees such as engineers and managers. Not all employees will have the skills to take initiative to do what it takes to coordinate the extraction of the data from all resources. Though I am a Technical Writer, I have acquired Project Management skills that allow me to create a plan to coordinate with resources, especially those who are hard to pin down, and to find workarounds and other solutions to help extract all of the data you want to publish. Your Documentation is One Element of Many that Complete Your Company Brand It is just as much part of your product as its other features and should complement it accordingly. Colors, styles, and logos can go a long way to making the documentation look like your documentation.

The task of gathering technical information, writing, and editing is given to an engineer or technical employee who hasn’t acquired any professional writer’s training or even basic skills, such as how to follow a writing style guide, or how to select and use the appropriate software for the job. This results in documentation that is hard to comprehend, full of errors and misspellings, and that doesn’t follow a common format which lends to it looking less than professional. Hiring a Professional Technical Writer Solves this Problem I help clarify complicated concepts through translating business and technical jargon into simpler language, helping your organization meet the needs of your target audience. I consider content from the user’s perspective and know how to connect to your audience through professional technical documentation that is concise, impartial, and states the facts clearly. I possess the special talent of understanding complex content from both the viewpoint of industry-experts and the average consumer. My primary objective beyond gathering information and understanding your process is to provide immaculate documentation that not only makes your organization meet its goals better, but also makes your organization look as professional as possible. But Don’t Think Traditional, Bland and Boring Technical Writing! Gone are the days of pages of static text with long paragraphs that make your head swim after just a few minutes of reading it. Today’s Technical Writing demands modern formatting, styling, and supportive media to be competitive and effective. I also have complementary skills that will enhance any kind of documentation I provide to you. These skills include web design, graphic design, motion graphics, video production, and other related skills that allow me to take your documentation to the next level. From the document layout and font to the appropriate size for charts, my job is to make your content look and read professional. And There’s More to Technical Writing than Just Writing Before the writing can even begin, the information to be published must be obtained. Technical Writing relies heavily on the ability to perform research to find the right stakeholders, subject matter experts, as well as internal and external resources. In a busy organization, it can be challenging to extract the information from employees such as engineers and managers. Not all employees will have the skills to take initiative to do what it takes to coordinate the extraction of the data from all resources. Though I am a Technical Writer, I have acquired Project Management skills that allow me to create a plan to coordinate with resources, especially those who are hard to pin down, and to find workarounds and other solutions to help extract all of the data you want to publish. Your Documentation is One Element of Many that Complete Your Company Brand It is just as much part of your product as its other features and should complement it accordingly.
