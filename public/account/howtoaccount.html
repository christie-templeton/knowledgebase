    <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;As an agency that works almost exclusively with WordPress I can&rsquo;t think of a better fit. The benefits are more than just WordPress based though: we used to spend $25 every month on a knowledge base, and we couldn&rsquo;t even export the data. Now we are free to do what we want with our data, and utilise it better. The lack of restrictions, opens so many possibilities. I can&rsquo;t recommend Heroic Knowledge Base enough, it&rsquo;s well designed and feels like a truly premium WordPress product.&rdquo; &ndash; <em>Nathan Monk, SMILE</em></p>
